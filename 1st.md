Two US senators are demanding that artificial intelligence companies shed light on their safety practices. This comes months after several families — including a Florida mom whose 14-year-old son died by suicide — sued startup Character.AI, claiming its chatbots harmed their children.

“We write to express our concerns regarding the mental health and safety risks posed to young users of character- and persona-based AI chatbot and companion apps,” Senators Alex Padilla and Peter Welch, both Democrats, wrote in a letter on Wednesday. The letter — which was sent to AI firms Character Technologies, maker of Character.AI, Chai Research Corp. and Luka, Inc., maker of chatbot service Replika — requests information on safety measures and how the companies train their AI models.

While more mainstream AI chatbots like ChatGPT are designed to be more general-purpose, Character.AI, Chai and Replika allow users to create custom chatbots — or interact with chatbots designed by other users — that can take on a range of personas and personality traits. Popular bots on Character.AI, for example, let users interact with replicas of fictional characters or practice foreign languages. But there are also bots that refer to themselves as mental health professionals or characters based on niche themes, including one that describes itself as “aggressive, abusive, ex military, mafia leader.”

The use of chatbots as digital companions is growing in popularity, with some users even treating them as romantic partners.

But the opportunity to create personalized bots has prompted concerns from experts and parents about users, especially young people, forming potentially harmful attachments to AI characters or accessing age-inappropriate content.

“This unearned trust can, and has already, led users to disclose sensitive information about their mood, interpersonal relationships, or mental health, which may involve self-harm and suicidal ideation—complex themes that the AI chatbots on your products are wholly unqualified to discuss,” the senators wrote in their letter, provided first to CNN. “Conversations that drift into this dangerous emotional territory pose heightened risks to vulnerable users.”
